# **Oxide**

Fast and efficient CI/CD pipeline written in Rust.

## **Overview**

**Oxide** is a cutting-edge Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline built entirely with the power of Rust. Designed for speed, efficiency, and reliability, Oxide is your go-to solution for automating the software development lifecycle.

### **Core Components**
Oxide is built around two primary components:

1. **Cargo_CI**  
   Handles all tasks related to Continuous Integration, including:
   - Automated builds
   - Code testing
   - Static analysis and linting
   - Reporting build and test results

2. **Cargo_CD**  
   Focuses on Continuous Delivery by managing:
   - Deployment workflows
   - Versioning and release management
   - Infrastructure provisioning
   - Monitoring post-deployment success

Together, these components form a seamless pipeline that supports robust CI/CD practices tailored to modern software development needs.

## **Key Features**
- **Fast and Lightweight:** Built in Rust for unparalleled performance and low resource consumption.
- **Modular Design:** Decouple CI and CD workflows for better customization and scalability.
- **Highly Configurable:** Supports custom pipelines with flexible configuration options.
- **Secure by Design:** Leverages Rust's memory safety guarantees to minimize vulnerabilities.
- **Extensible:** Add plugins or extend functionality with ease.

## **Why Oxide?**

1. **Speed:** Rust's efficiency ensures your builds and deployments are blazing fast.  
2. **Reliability:** Designed for robustness, reducing downtime and failures.  
3. **Simplicity:** Straightforward to set up and integrate into your projects.  
4. **Control:** Full ownership of your CI/CD pipeline without relying on third-party services.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (latest stable version recommended).  
- Ensure `cargo` is available in your environment.  
- Recommended: Familiarity with CI/CD concepts.

### **Installation**

To use Oxide in your projects:

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/oxide.git
   cd oxide
2. Build and run the pipeline:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ./target/release/oxide

### **Basic Usage**

1. Initialize a Project Pipeline:
   Use the CLI to initialize your CI/CD pipeline configuration
   ```bash
   oxide init
2. Run CI Tasks:
   Automate build and test processes with Cargo_CI:
   ```bash
   oxide run ci
3. Deploy with CD:
   Manage deployments using Cargo_CD:
   ```bash
   oxide run cd
4. Monitor Pipeline Status:
   Get real-time updates on CI/CD progress:
   ```bash
   oxide status

### **Architecture**
Oxide leverages a modular architecture for optimal performance and maintainability:
1. Cargo_CI Module: Encapsulates integration workflows, utilizing Rust's concurrency features for parallel task execution.
2. Cargo_CD Module: Implements delivery workflows, ensuring reliability with error-handling mechanisms.
3. Configuration Files: Supports YAML/JSON-based pipeline definitions.

### **Roadmap**
v1.0.0: Initial release with core CI/CD features.
Future Goals:
    1. Add containerization support (Docker/Kubernetes).
    2. Provide visual dashboards for pipeline monitoring.
    3. Enhance extensibility with plugin architecture.
